We evaluated the performance of the proposed method on six benchmark microarray cancer data sets.
These data sets are from the Bioinformatics Laboratory's online repository (http://www.biolab.si/supp/bi-cancer/projections/index.html) and the Gene Expression Omnibus (GEO) database platform.
The Lca data set contains cellular gene expression data from four distinct lung tumors, including adenocarcinoma, small cell lung cancer, squamous cell carcinoma, and carcinoid, as well as normal lung tissue.
MLL is a mixed lineage leukemia data set that includes 24 cases of acute lymphoblastic leukemia, 20 cases of mixed lineage leukemia, and 28 cases of acute myeloid leukemia. 
The SRBCT data set is a gene expression data set of small round blue-cell tumors and includes four distinct pediatric malignancies: Ewing's tumor family, neuroblastoma, non-lymphoma, Hodgkin's, and rhabdomyosarcoma. 
Due to the identical appearance of tiny round blue-cell tumors on traditional histology, screening for their marker genes is particularly significant.
The DLBCL data set contains 58 diffuse large B-cell lymphomas (DLBCL) samples and 19 follicular lymphomas (FL) samples.
FL frequently exhibits the same morphological and clinical characteristics as DLBCL over time. 
Therefore, it is crucial to screen for marker genes to differentiate between the two cancers.
The Glio dataset offers gene expression information for four distinct glioma subtypes: classical and non-classical gliomas and oligodendroglioma .
Pca102 is a prostate cancer dataset containing gene expression data for prostate cancers and neighboring non-tumorous prostate tissue samples .
We obtained Glio and Pca102 data sets from the Gene Expression Omnibus (GEO) database under accession IDs GSE82009 and GSE68907, which were taken with the URL  https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/geo/.
